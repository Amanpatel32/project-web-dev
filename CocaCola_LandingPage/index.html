          <p>
            Coca-Cola is a well-known soft drink that has been manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company since 1892. It was first served
            in 1886 by pharmacist John Pemberton at a soda fountain in Atlanta, Georgia, and has since become a global symbol of
            American tastes, available in more than 200 countries.
            
            The company has a long history of innovation and sustainability efforts. It has been refreshing the world and making a
            difference for over 138 years, with a purpose to improve people's lives and positively impact communities and the
            planet.
            
            Coca-Cola has faced criticism for its marketing practices and the health impacts of its products. A recent book, "Sweet
            and Deadly," details how the company worked for decades to discredit the science linking sugary sodas to chronic
            diseases through aggressive public relations campaigns.
            
            In recent news, Coca-Cola has been involved in various initiatives, including a trial of fossil-free plastic in
            collaboration with Swansea University to reduce its carbon footprint.
            The company also continues to innovate, expanding its footprint in the Alcohol Ready-to-Drink (aRTD) category with new
            product launches and exploring new ways to engage consumers through marketing.
            
            Coca-Cola's products were recalled in Europe due to elevated chlorate levels, and the company has been involved in
            sustainability projects and collaborations with artists and designers to create new expressions of creativity and
            cultural connections
